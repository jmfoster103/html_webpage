        <p>Through my time at Texas A&M, I have been able to experience many different technical opportunities in my classes, 
            that have allowed me to grow in my skills. These include classes and projects in Electrical Engineering, as well as 
            various software projects. Below are some examples of what I have worked on, and others that I would like to work 
            on in the future:
