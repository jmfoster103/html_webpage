            <p>As an Eagle Scout, I have grown up with a love for serving others. I have committed much of my life to helping others in 
            whatever way I can, whether that involves volunteering, or working in a service organization. I truly believe that the most
            fufilling thing that you can do with your time is to give back to others. </p>

            <p>One of the biggest service projects that I have completed was when I completed my Eagle Scout Project. 
                This was a great experience where I led a group of scouts in clearing out a large area of overgrowth at the 
                church my troop met at. We brought it all the way down to useable dirt, and tilled and added sod as well. This was a hugely
                rewarding experience</p>
            <h2 class="underline"><a href="https://fishcamp.tamu.edu/">Fish Camp at Texas A&M</a></h2>
            <p>Something that I am very acive in now is Fish Camp at Texas A&M. This is a 3 day 2 night introduction to the Aggie
                family and traditions. I specifically am a chair for crew, who are the people helping run the behind the scenes.
                The entire identity of what we do revolves around the selfless service for the incoming freshmen.

            <h2 class="underline"><a href="https://www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org/">Meals on Wheels</a></h2>
            <p>One of the first service experiences I had, which is what really got me passionate about it was the meals on wheels program.
                I started this when I was a young kid with my grandmother, and fell in love with helping others. We were able to deliver
                food to people who have difficulty getting it themselves, which can really make a difference in their day and even lives.
